## UNIT 1
Created the github repository

## UNIT 2
Set up the Elasticsearch and Kibana (screenshots inside [scrnshots/] folder)
There was problems trying to set up filebeats for my own json data as filebeats could not find the config file under /etc/filebeat/. 
This was circumvented by using the -c flag. However after doing filebeat setup, the assets could not be created. There is nothing that could be found on these cases on the internet.
